# Third Eye
```
This beat is making me see things that I didn't think I could see...

Loading third_eye.mp3 into `Sonic Visualizer` and adding a spectogram visualizer displayed hex characters.

`44 61 77 67 43 54 46 7b 73 79 6e 33 73 74 68 33 73 31 61 63 73 7d`

Converted from Hex to ASCII yields the flag.
